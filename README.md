## Calculators

### Price-Cost Margin (PCM)
The PCM measures a firm's ability to set prices above marginal cost, reflecting its market power.

#### **Formula:**
\[ PCM = rac{P - MC}{P} \]
Where:
- \( P \) is the Price.
- \( MC \) is the Marginal Cost.

#### **How to Use:**
1. Input the **Price** (P) of the product or service.
2. Input the **Marginal Cost** (MC) for producing one additional unit.
3. Click **Calculate** to get the PCM result.

---

### Lerner Index
The Lerner Index quantifies a firm's monopoly power by comparing price and marginal cost.

#### **Formula:**
\[ Lerner\ Index = rac{P - MC}{P} \]

#### **How to Use:**
1. Input the **Price** (P).
2. Input the **Marginal Cost** (MC).
3. Click **Calculate** to determine the Lerner Index.

---

### Profit Margin
The Profit Margin measures how much of a company’s revenue translates into profit.

#### **Formula:**
\[ Profit\ Margin = \left( rac{Net\ Profit}{Total\ Revenue} 
ight) 	imes 100 \]

#### **How to Use:**
1. Input the **Net Profit**.
2. Input the **Total Revenue**.
3. Click **Calculate** to get the Profit Margin.

---

### Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
HHI measures market concentration, indicating the level of competition within a market.

#### **Formula:**
\[ HHI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i^2 \]
Where:
- \( s_i \) is the market share of firm \( i \).

#### **How to Use:**
1. Enter the market shares of all firms.
2. Click **Calculate** to find the HHI result.

---

### Return on Assets (ROA)
ROA indicates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit.

#### **Formula:**
\[ ROA = \left( rac{Net\ Income}{Total\ Assets} 
ight) 	imes 100 \]

#### **How to Use:**
1. Input the **Net Income**.
2. Input the **Total Assets**.
3. Click **Calculate** to find the ROA.

---

### Return on Equity (ROE)
ROE measures a company’s profitability relative to shareholders’ equity.

#### **Formula:**
\[ ROE = \left( rac{Net\ Income}{Shareholders\ Equity} 
ight) 	imes 100 \]

#### **How to Use:**
1. Input the **Net Income**.
2. Input the **Shareholders' Equity**.
3. Click **Calculate** to find the ROE.

---

### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
This metric measures how the demand for one good responds to the price change of another.

#### **Formula:**
\[ Cross-Price\ Elasticity = rac{\Delta Q_x / Q_x}{\Delta P_y / P_y} \]

#### **How to Use:**
1. Input the **Change in Quantity** of Good X.
2. Input the **Quantity** of Good X.
3. Input the **Change in Price** of Good Y.
4. Input the **Price** of Good Y.
5. Click **Calculate** to determine the Cross-Price Elasticity.

---

### Economic Value Added (EVA)
EVA measures the value a company generates from funds invested in it, after accounting for the cost of capital.

#### **Formula:**
\[ EVA = NOPAT - (Capital 	imes WACC) \]

#### **How to Use:**
1. Input the **Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT)**.
2. Input the **Capital Invested**.
3. Input the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**.
4. Click **Calculate** to find the EVA.

---
